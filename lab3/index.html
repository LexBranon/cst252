<h1> Lab 3 File Structures </h1>
<p> The idea of this lab was the further create a local
		structure on my computer and add index.html files. </p>
<h2> Challenges </h2>
<p> Overall the lab was pretty easy because I had experience
		creating the file structures in 251 last semester. I
		had a little bit of trouble with creating my hero image option
		on my homepage to be the right dimensions. I ended up just
		changing the dimensions in illustrator and then adding it. </p>
<h2> Results </h2>
<p> I was able to create all the correct file structures. I was
	also able to set up a site wide css file and design my Homepage
	with links to all of the labs, a photo, and description of myself. </p>
