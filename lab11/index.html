				<h2> Challenge </h2>
					<p>With a partner, examine Javascript forms by implementing name input
						 form and sort users into houses based on their conditional input.
					</p>
				<h2> Problems </h2>
					<p>I had some problems at first, I felt my function was correct but my
						output wasn't displaying. I attended office hours which helped me a
						lot. Also, Aimee discovered that the way I had linked my java was
						incorrect. This will help me a lot moving forward.
					</p>
				<h2> Results </h2>
					<p> I got everything to work! Yay! I also added music for a little
						extra something something.
