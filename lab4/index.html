	<h2> Challenge </h2>
	<p> The idea of this lab was to get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.
	</p>
	<h2> Problems </h2>
	<p> The hardest part of this lab was for us to figure out what tasks we wanted to complete. Once we did, it
		went pretty quickly. We also were tripped up by the instructions a couple times. This was solved by re-reading them
		a lot! But Aimee and I were able to navigate it together.
	</p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> I was able to create all the correct file structures. I was
		also able to add "javascript." </p>
