	<h1> Lab 9 - Javascript for Web </h1>

	<img src = "img/doms.png">

	<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p>With a partner, examine Javascript for web use.
		</p>
	<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>I first worked in my console, everything worked there. However, I had a
			problem when I tried on local and to the server seeing any output. I have
			no idea why this isn't working after I've tried experimenting to fix it.
			My assumption is that it has something to do with the id I chose.
		</p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> I'm happy I got everything correct in the java itself. However, I was
			not able to see the output on the site istself.
