	<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> The idea of this lab was to work with your partner, experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables.
		</p>
	<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> This lab was not as hard as I initially thought it was going to be. I am still a little shaky when it comes
			to javascript inputs, but I thibk this was a good intro. Aimee and I struggled at first to link our javascript page to
			our html when following the instructions. But we realized it was because we had named our js file something different
			than the instructions had.
		</p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> I was able to use javascript stucture to calculate my cars age and link
		that information to my webpage.  </p>
