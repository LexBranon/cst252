				<h1> Lab 13: Debugging </h1>

				<h2> Challenge </h2>
					<p>With a partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.
					</p>
				<h2> Problems </h2>
					<p>My original problem was with lab 10. I was happy to find the problems
						easily by inspecting. I had a problem figuring out how to fix my
						addEventListener code at first. But realized it wasnt corresponding
						to my html correctly.
					</p>
				<h2> Results </h2>
					<p> I was able to unbug my lab 10.

				<div id=caption> <p>The first image is when I inspected the page. I found an error on line
						37 of my javascript code. I went to the javascript and realized that
						the error was in my addEventListener function. I readjusted my java
						and then changed my html to reflect it.
