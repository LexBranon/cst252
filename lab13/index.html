				<h1> Lab 13: Debugging </h1>

				<h2> Challenge </h2>
					<p>With a partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.
					</p>
				<h2> Problems </h2>
					<p>I had an easy time creating my original function. It took me a little
						bit to figure out to put the 15 and 35 on top. But everything worked
						and printed correctly in the console. Where I had problems was with
						the output. For some reason, I could not get it to output on my web page.
					</p>
				<h2> Results </h2>
					<p> I was able to create a function that works in the console, and a
						form field. I was not able to get it to output correctly. I will be
						asking for help with this in class.
					</p>
