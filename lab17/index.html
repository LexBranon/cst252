				<h2> Challenge </h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with jQuery.
					</p>
				<h2> Problems </h2>
					<p>This lab ended up being easier than I thought it was going to be. I
						had to rewatch the lecture in order to fully understand at first, but
						then I was able to do it.
					</p>
				<h2> Results </h2>
					<p> I was able to add a button through jQuery that creates a pop up window
						and made it a nice green color.
