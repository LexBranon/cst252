		<h4> Me after this lab... </h4>
	<img src = "img/cry.jpg">

	<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p>The challenge was to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.
		</p>
	<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>This lab was really difficult for me. I was able to set an array and set
			a function for squaring the array. But then nothing else worked. I also had
			trouble getting the js to show up in my html output.

		</p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> I was able to set an array and set a function to square root the array.
