	<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> The idea of this lab was to write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.
		</p>
	<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> I had a lot of trouble with this lab. I was about to input the inital name input function.
			But when I got to randomizing and adding arrays, it got a lot harder for me. Took a lot of guess and check
			and help from w3schools and example.
		</p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> I created a name input function and randomized it. </p>
