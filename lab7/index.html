	<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> The idea of this lab was to write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.
		</p>
	<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> This lab was pretty easy because it was pretty similar to last lab.
			I struggled at first making sure I knew how to input an array and an object
			in the console. But after some practice I got it to work.
		</p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> I was able to use javascript stucture to calculate my cars age and link
		that information to my webpage.  </p>
