				<h2> Challenge </h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with loops.
					</p>
				<h2> Problems </h2>
					<p>I had an easy time creating my original function. It took me a little
						bit to figure out to put the 15 and 35 on top. But everything worked
						and printed correctly in the console. Where I had problems was with
						the output. For some reason, I could not get it to output on my web page.
					</p>
				<h2> Results </h2>
					<p> I was able to create a function that works in the console, and a
						form field. I was not able to get it to output correctly. I will be
						asking for help with this in class.


					</p>

					<div id = "output">
					<form action="/action_page.php">
					  <label for="fname">Please enter a number up to 200: </label><br>
						  <input type="text" id="input" name="fname"><br>

					<button id="button">Submit</button>
