			 		<h1>Lab 20: JSON and APIs</h1>
						<h2> Challenge </h2>
			 			<p>Working with your partner, experiment with processing JSON from an API.</p>

			 			<h2>Problems</h2>
			 			<p>I was able to follow the example that we did in class so I didn't have too
						man issues completing this lab. At first my output wasn't working but I
					  I realized it was something I was doing in my output div.</p>

			 			<h2>Results</h2>
			 			<p>I sucessfully added APIs in order to link to comics. I also added a
						button that allows users to navigate forwards and backwards. </p>
